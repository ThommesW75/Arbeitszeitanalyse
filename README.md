Working Time Analysis - Portfolio Project

A portfolio project for analyzing working hours using Python, IaC, and DaC.
Current Status: Version 1.0

The core logic of the analysis tool is implemented in Python. The current version can:

    Analyze a hardcoded list of employee data (name and hours).

    Categorize employees based on their working hours (overtime, undertime, etc.).

    Print a summary report to the console.

    Infrastructure (Terraform): In Progress - The infrastructure code for the application and database components has been structured.

For more details on the Python application, see the Python-App README.
Project Vision / Roadmap

This project will be developed iteratively. Future steps include:

    [ ] Phase 2: Storing and retrieving data from a database.

    [ ] Phase 3: Containerizing the Python application and the database using Docker.

    [x] Phase 4: Defining the required infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform.

    [ ] Phase 5: Managing the application and infrastructure with configuration management tools like Ansible.
