Python Application: Working Time Analysis (Core Logic)

This directory contains the Python script that forms the core logic of the analysis tool.
Features (Version 1.0)

The script zeiterfassung_v1.py currently performs the following tasks:

    Data Source: Uses a hardcoded list of dictionaries within the script to simulate employee data.

    Analysis: It iterates through the list and checks if an employee has worked 10 or more hours, exactly 9 hours, or less than 8 hours.

    Reporting: Prints a formatted summary to the terminal, listing the names and counts of employees in each category.

How to Run

To execute the script, navigate to the main project directory (Arbeitszeitanalyse) and run the following command in your terminal:
